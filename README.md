## Docker Compose

The docker-compose has been defined to configure the multi docker images available in this project.

## Running the application in the docker

First you have to run ```./gradlew build docker``` command in order to assembly the components to be picked up correctly by the Dockerfile configuration.

Once the above step is complete, you can issue the command: ```docker-compose up --build```
   
## NGINX
The Nginx has been configured to forward the requests between backend and frontend. The requests prefixed with **/api** will be forward to the backend service otherwise the React JS module will handle the requests.
